Exercise 13.4: Explain why the final simplification of the grammar for arithmetic
expressions has a dramatic effect on the efficiency of the resulting parser.

Hint: begin by considering how an expression comprising a single number would be
parsed if this simplification step had not been made.

expr ::= term + expr | term
term ::= factor * term | factor
factor ::= ( expr ) | nat
nat ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | ...

expr ::= term (+ expr | Є)
term ::= factor (* term | Є)
factor ::= ( expr ) | nat
nat ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | ...

In the first grammar, the parser will first attempt to parse a natural as a
"term + expr", realize that there is no '+', fail and backtrack and attempt the
other case as a "term". The same thing happens in the rule for term resulting in
four attempts to parse a natural.

term + expr
factor * term
nat n
fail (*)

term + expr
factor
nat n
fail (+)

term
factor * term
nat n
fail (*)

term
factor
nat n
success

The second grammar rules are optionally followed by an addition, multiplication,
or nothing, so that a natural will be parsed once.

term
factor
nat n
success
