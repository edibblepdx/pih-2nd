-- Exercise 12.2: Complete the following instance declaration to make the
-- partially-applied function type (a ->) into a functor:

instance Functor ((->) a) where
  -- fmap :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
  fmap = (.)

{-
when f = (->) a
then f b = (->) a b = a -> b
and  f c = (->) a c = a -> c
