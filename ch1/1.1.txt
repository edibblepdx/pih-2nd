Exercise 1.1: Give another possible calculation for the results of double (double 2).

double (double 2)
=   { applying outer double }
double 2 + double 2
=   { applying the first double }
(2 + 2) + double 2
=   { applying the second double }
(2 + 2) + (2 + 2)
=   { applying the first + }
4 + (2 + 2)
=   { applying the second + }
4 + 4
=   { applying + }
