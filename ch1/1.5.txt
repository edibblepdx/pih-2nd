Exercise 1.5: What would be the effect of replacing <= by < in the original definition of
qsort? Hist: consider the example qsort [2,2,3,1,1].

Answer: Duplicate items would be dropped

qsort [2,2,3,1,1]
=   { applying qsort }
qsort [1, 1] ++ [2] ++ qsort [3]
= { applying qsort }
([] ++ [1] ++ []) ++ [2] ++ [3]
=   { applying ++ }
[1] ++ [2] ++ [3]
=   { applying ++ }
[1, 2, 3]
