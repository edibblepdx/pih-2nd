Exercise 3.5: Why is it not feasible for a function to implement Eq?

You would have to check an infinite number of inputs
to determine function equality.

Let f :: Int -> Int be 0 for all input x, and 
let g :: Int -> Int be {1 if x is 0; 0 otherwise}.
Then f /= g. Even on a subset of the real line,
there are infinite real inputs by the density
property.

If the output type of f and g implement Eq then
comparison is feasible for single input.
